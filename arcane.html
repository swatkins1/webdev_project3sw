            I love this woman, however that rocket was coming towards her. Might have been the last thing she’ll ever see.
            I saw her mom in the trailer, and yet I did not see her. So I think her mom will step up and maybe follow Mel’s
            route of peace, or lash out in revenge for losing another child. Or maybe she’ll be gravely injured and put on
            the sidelines for most of season 2.

            Although not a part of the council, he was there when the final voting happened. He’s gonna live, however he may
            also be gravely injured as well. He’s got to get to that final in-game form one way or another.

            Going by one of his quotes, “The Arcane is the curse of our world. My race was nearly destroyed by it,” I think
            he’s screwed for sure. The rocket uses arcane, otherwise known as magic. His kind may be wiped out with the
            rocket, sadly.

            He can’t even solve a puzzle made for kids. He has no purpose to the story besides comic relief or being someone
            to hate. He might live.

            This is the only one with major spoilers because it’s quite literally revealed in one of the trailers. One of
            the enforcers says, "We will avenge your mother," to who I assume would be Caitlyn. She’s definitely not going
            to see season 2.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          In conclusion, I will avoid any spoilers or trailers for season 2. I want to go in completely blind on November
          23rd and watch the whole season in one go. Enjoy the intro for the show!
